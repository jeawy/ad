  "readme": "CakePop!\n========\n[CakePop][cakepop] is a set of Node.js build helpers and CoffeeScript Cake\nextensions. It provides various utility wrappers for bash shell commands and\nother Node.js binary process executions.\n\nNotwithstanding it's CoffeeScript-friendliness, CakePop runs off of real\nJavaScript without CoffeeScript dependencies, and is thus appropriate for\nuse in pure JavaScript code (e.g., with Jakefiles).\n\n[api]: http://ryan-roemer.github.com/node-cakepop\n[cakepop]: https://github.com/ryan-roemer/node-cakepop\n[cakefile]: https://github.com/ryan-roemer/node-cakepop/blob/master/Cakefile\n\nSee the [API documentation][api] for full information, or CakePop's own\n[`Cakefile`][cakefile] for some example usage.\n\nDocumentation is presently in source comments in `cakepop.coffee`. While not\nideal, the source is quite readable. There will be a more friendly version in\nthe future.\n\n**Warning**: The library is currently undergoing a lot of restructuing and\nchange, so expect the API to drastically change until things settle down.\nBreaking changes will be versioned (with git tags and in NPM), but that's\nabout it for now.\n\nInstallation\n============\nTo get the library:\n\n    $ npm install cakepop\n\nCakePop does **not** install dependencies for tasks that are shell-invoked,\nto keep the library small and let the user install the proper version of a\nlibrary (like `coffeelint`). So, you will need manual installations for the\nfollowing:\n\n* CoffeeScript Build Tasks: `npm install coffee-script`\n* Coffeelint: `npm install coffeelint`\n\nBasic Usage\n===========\nHere are some common `Cakefile` tasks that CakePop can help with.\n\nExec / spawn a bash process:\n\n    utils = require(\"cakepop\").utils\n\n    task \"hello1\", \"Exec 'hello world'\", ->\n      utils.exec \"echo Hello World\"\n\n    task \"hello2\", \"Spawn 'hello world'\", ->\n      utils.spawn \"echo\", [\"Hello World\"]\n\nBuild CoffeeScript files to JavaScript:\n\n    builder = new (require(\"cakepop\").CoffeeBuild)()\n\n    task \"source:build\", \"Build CoffeeScript to JavaScript.\", ->\n      builder.build [\n        \"foo.coffee\"\n        { \"src_dir\": \"dest_dir\" }\n      ]\n\nSee the API documentation for more.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\nCakePop is Copyright 2012 Ryan Roemer.
